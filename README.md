<h2>Foreign Country Planner</h2><p>The project is a Python Django application that predicts which country a user can go to for education based on their age and grade point average.</p><h2>General Information</h2>
<hr><ul>
<li>The project is a web-based application built using Python Django, HTML, Bootstrap, and machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Joblib. It allows users to input their age and grade point average (GPA) to predict which country they may be eligible to go to for educational purposes. The application utilizes machine learning models to make the prediction based on the user's input data, offering personalized suggestions for study destinations.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>The project solves the problem of helping students determine which countries they may be eligible to study in based on their age and grade point average (GPA). It provides a quick and easy way to get recommendations for potential study destinations, eliminating the need for students to manually research requirements for different countries or universities. This tool helps students make informed decisions about their educational opportunities abroad.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>The purpose of this project is to assist students in identifying potential study destinations abroad by predicting which countries they are eligible to study in based on their age and grade point average (GPA). It aims to simplify the decision-making process for students considering international education, providing personalized recommendations to help them choose the best options based on their academic background. The project also showcases the application of machine learning and web development skills to solve real-world problems.</li>
